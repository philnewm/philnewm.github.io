description: Set up basic CI for Ansible using Molecule
---
# Getting started with Molecule

## Intro

---

This article is intended as a guide to set up Ansible Molecule for testing Ansible roles by running them against virtual machines. These virtual machines will be controlled by Vagrant using VirtualBox as provider.

<!-- more -->

The code in this guide was developed and tested on AlmaLinux9 and Ubuntu22.04 for the software versions mentioned in [Requirements](#requirements)

## Requirements

---

### System

Since we will use *VirtualBox* virtual Machines in this guide it's required for your system to have virtualization enabled in your mainboard's BIOS or UEFI.
Check this [article](https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/how-to-enable-virtualization-in-bios-for-intel-and-amd/) for further details

This guide is intended to be followed on a Linux system.
This article assumes you got a basic understanding of Ansible and how to operate within the Linux terminal.
To follow this [guide on a Windows system](https://ultahost.com/knowledge-base/install-ansible-on-windows/) you will need to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) since Ansible is not supported on Windows.
It does however support remote controlling [Windows hosts](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/intro_windows.html).

### Python

You will need python >= 3.10 to install the latest versions of all required python packages.
Additional the python-venv and python-pip package will be required.
Here just the example install command for Ubuntu22.04
`sudo apt-get install python3.12 python3.12-venv python3-pip`

> [!tip] Creating a [python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) for Ansible first is highly recommended.

```shell
python3.12 -m venv ~/.venv/ansible_env
source ~/.venv/ansible_env/bin/activate
```

Next we need a bunch of python packages like Ansible, Molecule and its *Vagrant* plugin.

Create a project directory and `cd` into it.
At the time of writing there seems to be a [bug](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-plugins/issues/301) with the latest version of molecule (v25.3.1) in context of the molecule plugins package.
That's why we go for the versions listed here since they seem to work fine together.
Create a `requirements.txt` file containing these lines:

```shell
ansible==11.3.0
molecule==25.1.0
molecule-plugins==23.7.0
molecule-plugins[vagrant]
docker==7.1.0
```

> [!tip]- docker python packages
> Installing the docker python package is only necessary due to a bug [#32540](https://github.com/ansible/molecule/issues/2540) in molecule plugins.
> A fix for this one is already merged, see [#166](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-plugins/issues/166) but no new release happened so far.

Now you can run `upgrade pip` and install the requirements.

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Tools

As the title suggests you also need *Virtualbox* and *Vagrant* installed to follow along.

**Vagrant** is a virtual machine management tool which allows molecule to create, start and remove virtual machines in an automated way.
**VirtualBox** on the other hand is the virtualization provider and handles all the heavy lifting when it comes to virtualizing your hardware.
See the following table for download pages and version used for the following examples.

| Tool       | Download Page                                                       | Version used here |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Virtualbox | [Installers](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)             | 7.1.6             |
| Vagrant    | [Install commands](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install) | 2.4.3             |

```shell
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install vagrant -y
```

The provided key file command for RPM-based Linux distributions on the VirtualBox website didn't work for me - So I changed it to the one below to make it work.

~~~tabs
---tab apt-get
```bash linenums="1" title="Install on Debian-based systems"
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/oracle-virtualbox-2016.gpg] https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian $(lsb_release -sc) contrib" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
wget -O- https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc | sudo gpg --yes --output /usr/share/keyrings/oracle-virtualbox-2016.gpg --dearmor
sudo apt-get update --refresh
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-7.1 -y
```
---tab dnf
```bash linenums="1" title="Install on RedHat-based systems"
wget -q https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc && sudo rpm --import oracle_vbox_2016.asc
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/el/virtualbox.repo
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install VirtualBox-7.1 -y
```
~~~

Verify the successful installation of both tools by checking their version.

```bash linenums="1"
VBoxManage --version
vagrant --version
```

## Prepare development environment

---

Initially I came across many guides mentioning the command `molecule role init`.
This one doesn't exist anymore since version [6.0.0](https://github.com/ansible/molecule/releases/tag/v6.0.0) - it was removed intentional to get rid of the [Ansible-Galaxy](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy) dependency.
By now you simply use the `ansible-galaxy role init` command to initialize an Ansible role and initialize a molecule scenario from within the role afterwards.

```shell
ansible-galaxy role init example
cd example
molecule init scenario
```

For now we'll just go with the *default* scenario to keep it simple.
Now you got a "molecule" directory inside the role containing a bunch of default .yml files.

```code title="Role Structure"
ðŸ“¦sample_role
 â”£ ðŸ“‚defaults
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmain.yml
 â”£ ðŸ“‚files
 â”£ ðŸ“‚handlers
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmain.yml
 â”£ ðŸ“‚meta
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmain.yml
 â”£ ðŸ“‚molecule
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚default
 â”ƒ   â”£ ðŸ“œconverge.yml
 â”ƒ   â”£ ðŸ“œcreate.yml
 â”ƒ   â”£ ðŸ“œdestroy.yml
 â”ƒ   â”— ðŸ“œmolecule.yml
 â”£ ðŸ“‚tasks
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmain.yml
 â”£ ðŸ“‚templates
 â”£ ðŸ“‚tests
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œinventory
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œtest.yml
 â”£ ðŸ“‚vars
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmain.yml
 â”— ðŸ“œREADME.md
```

For details about how each file and directory inside this role structure is supposed to be used see the [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-directory-structure)

## Instance Creation

---

### Default Instance

Creating a molecule instance is done by running `molecule create` if you do that right away from the roles root directory you will most likely encounter the following error:

```code
ERROR    Computed fully qualified role name of sample does not follow current galaxy requirements.
Please edit meta/main.yml and assure we can correctly determine full role name:

galaxy_info:
role_name: my_name  # if absent directory name hosting role is used instead
namespace: my_galaxy_namespace  # if absent, author is used instead
```

This happens due to molecule running a [role name-check](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/configuration/#role-name-check) by default.
As stated in the documentation you can either disable the check or just add the `role_name` and `namespace` to the `meta/main.yml` file.

Running `molecule create` after adding these should, while throwing a bunch of warnings, already work.
Running `molecule list` should now show a table similar to this one.

| Instance Name | Driver Name | Provisioner Name | Scenario Name | Created | Converged |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------- | --------- |
| instance      | default     | ansible          | default       | true    | false     |

This will create a default instance using the [delegated driver](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/configuration/#delegated), which is just called "default".
As the title suggests we will use Vagrant as driver with VirtualBox as a provider in this example.
So run `molecule destroy` to remove that default instance again.
If you run `molecule drivers` you should see a list of installed drivers including `vagrant`.
In case vagrant  is missing, please check again if you installed all [requirements](#requirements), including the Vagrant plugin.
Take a look at the [molecule-plugins repository](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-plugins/blob/main/README.md) for additional information

### Cleaning up

Molecule stores all instance-related data in a so called *ephermal directory* and removes it when running `molecule reset`.
It's placed at `~/.cache/molecule/<role-name>/<scenario-name>` by default.
Running `molecule reset` might result in a python-traceback in some versions of molecule-plugins before version [v23.6.0](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-plugins/releases/tag/v23.6.0), which is related to docker on RHEL-systems but will still work and remove the directory as expected.

> [!warning]- Python traceback explanation for `molecule reset`
> Indicates docker and or the python module isn't installed on your system, see [#166](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-plugins/issues/166)
> Happens e.g. on Almalinux 9 due to podman being the default container service instead of docker and molecule doesn't seem to like this.

### Vagrant Instance

```yaml
---

driver:
  name: vagrant
  provider:
    name: virtualbox
platforms:
  # Defaults to Alpine Linux in case no box details are provided
  - name: Alma9
    box: almalinux/9
    box_version: "9.5.20241203"
    memory: 2048
    cpus: 2
    interfaces:
      - auto_config: true
        network_name: private_network
        type: "static"
        ip: "192.168.56.10"
provisioner:
  name: ansible
  config_options:
    defaults:
      stdout_callback: debug
      callbacks_enabled: ansible.posix.profile_tasks
    env:
      ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR: "true"
verifier:
  name: ansible
  enabled: True

...
```

You can find some explanation of all these settings in the [Ansible molecule docs](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/getting-started/#inspecting-the-moleculeyml)
> [!info]- VirtualBox Network Setup
> Assigning a network-interface using a `192.168.56.X` address is crucial here.
> VirtualBox sets up two virtual networks  by default.
>
> * vboxnet0 - which is Host-only using 192.168.56.1
> * NatNetwork - using 10.0.2.X
>
> NatNetwork will be used by default but requires port forwarding from the host to the VM to make it accessible from e.g. a browser on the host
> To get around this we just assign a static address from the host-only network.

Line 7: Same goes for the `verify.yml` playbook

Running `molecule create` and `molecule list` when it's done should now display a vagrant instance.

### Access Vagrant Instance

Accessing an instance is supposed to be done by running `molecule login`, this might not work correctly for versions before [v23.6.0](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-plugins/releases/tag/v23.6.0) due to a [bug](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-plugins/issues/239).
If you are using a version >= v23.6.0 this should work right away.
If you encounter this issue you can run `vagrant global-status` to get the vagrant instance IDs and `vagrant ssh <id>` to log into one of the VMs displayed. Afterwards just type `exit` to drop out of the instance again.

## Provision a service

---

After setting up this vagrant instance successfully it is now time to make it do something using Ansible as its provisioner. We will use these tasks so set up an Apache web-server.
This is just a very basic example for demonstration.

```yaml
---

- name: Gather facts
  ansible.builtin.gather_facts:

- name: Install Apache web server
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.package:
    name: httpd
    state: present

- name: Ensure Apache is started and enabled on boot
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: "httpd"
    state: "started"
    enabled: true

- name: Create default index.html
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    content: |
      <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Welcome to Apache on AlmaLinux!</h1>
      </body>
      </html>
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: '0644'
  register: default_page

- name: Restart Apache service
  become: true
  when: default_page.changed
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: httpd
    state: restarted

- name: Display VM IP address
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: ansible_all_ipv4_addresses

...
```

Now replace the content of `tasks/main.yml` with these yaml tasks.

Next run `molecule converge` to run these tasks against the VirtualBox VM.
After this ran successfully you should be able to just copy the IP address displayed by the debug task e.g. `192.168.56.10` to your browser and see the default Apache web-server page right away.

Even tho this is nice, testing the functionality of this web-server manually isn't quite a scalable approach. It's time to set up automated testing for this role.

## Test Vagrant Instance

---

We will use [Ansible for testing](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/configuration/?h=#molecule.verifier.ansible.Ansible) as well to stay with the default and to keep it simple. Another popular option for molecule testing is [testinfra](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/configuration/?h=#molecule.verifier.testinfra.Testinfra)
Take a look now at these test tasks which should be self-explanatory due to their names.

```yaml
---

- name: Gather package facts
  ansible.builtin.package_facts:

- name: Gather service facts
  ansible.builtin.service_facts:

- name: Test Apache package is installed
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - "'httpd' in ansible_facts.packages"
    fail_msg: "Apache package 'httpd' is not installed"
    quiet: true

- name: Test Apache service is running
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - ansible_facts.services['httpd.service'].state == 'running'
    fail_msg: "Apache service is not running"
    quiet: true

- name: Query Apache default web page
  ansible.builtin.uri:
    url: "http://{{ ansible_all_ipv4_addresses[0] }}"
  register: web_check

- name: Test Apache is reachable
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - web_check.status == 200
    fail_msg: "Web server is not reachable or did not return status code 200"
    success_msg: "Web server is reachable and returned status code 200"

...
```

Place these tasks into a file called `tests.yml` in the tasks directory to make them easily accessible.
Now you should be able to run `molecule verify` to have these tests run against the VM.

@@TODO add user/super-user prefix to commands

## Wrap-Up

___

Now you got a basic functional setup to implement an Ansible role and test it in a automated and easy to use way against VirtualBox virtual Machines.
This kind of setup is also quite extensible with additional automations and convenience features as I'll show you in the following articles of this series.
